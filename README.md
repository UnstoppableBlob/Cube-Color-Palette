# Cube Color Palette

## Description

This is an easy way to find colors that you might need in painting, and game development.

## How To Use It

Just click on the cube, hover over your selected color, and the hex code will appear underneath it. You can then copy the hex code to use wherever you like.

Later, I want to turn this into web component and make it work like an actual color picker.
