# Cube Color Palette

## Description

This is an fun and unique color palette that let's you choose from 216 shades of 6 colors (one color on each face of the cube).

## How To Use It

Just click on the cube, hover over your selected color, and the hex code will appear underneath it. You can then copy the hex code to use wherever you like.

Later, I want to turn this into web component and make it work like an actual color picker.
